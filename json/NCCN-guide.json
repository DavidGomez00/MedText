Accurate orientation of the surgical specimens is required for optimal\nmargin evaluation.\n\u2022 Pathology report should include:\n\u0017Description of the gross and microscopic margin status.\n\u0017Reporting of the distance, orientation, and type of tumor (invasive or DCIS) in relation to the closest margin.\n\u0017Quantification of the extent of disease that is approximating the inked margin.\n\u2022 For mammographically detected DCIS with microcalcifications, complete resection should be documented by analysis of margins and\nspecimen radiography. Post-excision mammography can be considered if there is uncertainty.\n\u2022 The NCCN Panel accepts the definitions of negative margins after breast-conservation therapy from the 2014 SSO/ASTRO Margins\nGuideline1 for Stage I/II Invasive Cancers and the 2016 SSO/ASTRO/ASCO Guideline for DCIS.2 For patients with stage I or II invasive cancers\nafter BCS, a positive margin is defined as \u201cink on tumor\u201d (any invasive cancer or DCIS cells on ink). These patients generally require further\nsurgery\u2014either a re-excision to achieve a negative margin or a mastectomy. If re-excision is technically feasible to allow for BCS to achieve\n\u201cno ink on tumor,\u201d this can be done with resection of the involved margin guided by the orientation of the initial resection specimen or re-\nexcision of the entire original excision cavity. There may be select patients with stage III invasive cancers who may be eligible for BCS. For\nthese patients, the margins status would be accessed with similar definitions.\nDCIS\n\u2022 For patients with pure DCIS treated by BCS and whole breast RT, a quantitative description of any tumor close to margin resection width\nof at least 2 mm is associated with a reduced risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) relative to narrower negative margin widths,\nwhile the routine practice of obtaining margins >2 mm to further improve outcomes is not supported by the evidence. When there is only\nminimal or focal DCIS involvement near the margin, clinical judgment should be utilized to weigh the risks of re-excision with risk of\nrecurrence for an individual patient.\n\u2022 For patients with DCIS treated with excision alone (no whole breast RT), regardless of margin width, there is a substantially higher rate of\nIBTR than treatment with excision and whole breast RT, even in predefined, patients who are low risk. Although the optimal margin width\nfor treatment with excision alone is unknown, it should be at least 2 mm, with some evidence suggesting improved IBTR rates with margin\nwidths wider than 2 mm.\n\u2022 DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-M), defined as an invasive focus \u22641 mm in size, should refer to the DCIS margin definition when considering\nthe optimal margin width (>2 mm), given that the majority of DCIS-M is comprised of DCIS and systemic therapy utilization for this lesion\nmore closely reflects the treatment pattern for DCIS than for invasive carcinoma.\nContinued\n1 Moran MS, Schnitt SJ, Giuliano AE, et al.

In this setting, \u201cno ink on tumor\u201d is recommended for either DCIS or invasive\ncancer cells, primarily because the natural history, treatment, and outcomes of these lesions are more similar to invasive cancer than DCIS.\nFor specifically challenging cases, clinical judgment and discussion with the patient should precede routine re-excision.\n\u2022 These margin recommendations cannot be applied directly to patients undergoing APBI/PBI,1 where data regarding local recurrence are\nmore limited. Furthermore, individualized clinical judgment should be utilized on a case-by-case basis, using postoperative mammography\nto identify residual calcifications and clinical-pathologic factors such as quantitative extent of disease near margin, presence of extensive\nintraductal component (EIC),3 young age, or multiple close margins to assist in identifying patients who may have an increased risk of IBTR\nand therefore may be selected to benefit from re-excision.\n\u2022 For patients with invasive breast cancer after BCS, with microscopically focally positive margins (in the absence of an EIC),3 the use of a\nhigher radiation boost dose to the tumor bed may be considered, since generally a boost to the tumor bed is recommended for patients at\nhigher risk of recurrence.

All Rights Reserved.\nNCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nInvasive Breast Cancer\nDiscussion\nPRINCIPLES OF BREAST RECONSTRUCTION AFTER SURGERY\nGeneral Principles of Breast Reconstruction\n\u2022 Breast reconstruction may be an option for any patient receiving surgical treatment for breast cancer. All patients undergoing breast\ncancer treatment should be educated about breast reconstructive options as adapted to their individual clinical situation. However,\nbreast reconstruction should not interfere with the appropriate surgical, medical, and radiation management of the cancer or the scope of\nappropriate surgical treatment for this disease. Coordinating consultation and surgical treatment with a reconstructive surgeon should be\nexecuted within a reasonable time frame. The process of breast reconstruction should not govern the timing or the scope of appropriate\nsurgical treatment for this disease. The availability of or the practicality of breast reconstruction should not result in the delay or refusal of\nappropriate surgical, medical, and radiation intervention.\n\u2022 Some patients may choose not to have reconstruction after mastectomy. The option to undergo mastectomy alone with a surgically\noptimized closure should be offered to all patients as part of a comprehensive discussion of reconstructive options. Achieving the optimal\nresult in this scenario may require additional procedures beyond the initial mastectomy. See BINV-H (6) for patient factors influencing choice\nof reconstruction.\n\u2022 Selection of reconstructive option and timing of reconstruction option is based on an assessment of cancer treatment, body habits of\npatients, obesity, smoking history, comorbidities, and patient concerns. Smoking and obesity (WHO Class 2 and 3) increase the risk of\nperioperative complications for all types of breast reconstruction. Patients with these high-risk factors should be counseled about their\nincreased risk for complications following breast reconstruction, including donor site complications/hernias and bulges of the abdominal\nwall, delayed healing, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, total flap failure (obesity), and implant failure (smoking).\n\u2022 Nipple areolar reconstruction should be offered to patients if the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) has been removed as part of their cancer\ntreatment. Various techniques are available for nipple reconstruction. Three-dimensional (3-D) tattooing can be offered to patients as an\noption for NAC reconstruction.\n\u2022 Additionally, patients who are not satisfied with the cosmetic outcome following completion of breast cancer treatment should be offered\nreconstructive surgery consultation.\n\u2022 Patients known to harbor genetic mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer may opt to undergo bilateral prophylactic mastectomies\nwith reconstruction. Reconstruction can be performed with prosthetic, autologous tissue, or a combination of implant with autologous\ntissue.\n\u2022 Skin-sparing mastectomy should be performed by an experienced breast surgery team that works in a coordinated, multidisciplinary fashion\nto guide proper patient selection for skin-sparing mastectomy, determine optimal sequencing of the reconstructive procedure(s) in relation\nto adjuvant therapies, and perform a resection that achieves appropriate surgical margins.\n\u2022 Revisional surgery may be necessary after breast reconstruction. This may include procedures such as fat grafting, mastopexy, direct\nexcision/suction-assisted lipectomy, contralateral procedures (in cases of unilateral reconstruction), and others. Patients should be informed\nbefore reconstruction that revision surgery may be necessary.\nContinued\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.\nBINV-H\n5 OF 7\nVersion 5.2025, 10/16/25 \u00a9 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network\u00ae (NCCN\u00ae), All rights reserved.

Individual patients present preoperatively with\na variety of factors that may impact the choice of reconstruction, the risk of complications, donor site morbidity, and aesthetic result. Each\nof these factors must be taken into account, along with patient desire, to choose the optimal method of reconstruction.\n\u2022 Patient desire\n\u0017The patient may have a strong feeling towards one form of reconstruction after being given the options. Breast reconstruction should be a\nshared decision.\n\u2022 Medical comorbidities\n\u0017Medical comorbidities may preclude longer reconstructive procedures such as autologous tissue reconstruction in some patients.\n\u0017The selection of the reconstructive method of choice should take into consideration patient comorbidities.\n\u0017Poorly controlled diabetes is a risk factor for postoperative complications in both implant and autologous tissue reconstruction.\n\u0017Patients should be screened for personal or familial thrombophilia. Thrombophilia may result in reconstructive failure of microsurgical\nreconstruction or thromboembolic events.\n\u2022 Tobacco use\n\u0017Smoking has been associated with increased risk of delayed wound healing, mastectomy flap necrosis, NAC necrosis in the setting of\nnipple-sparing mastectomy, infection, and failure of implant-based reconstruction. In free flap reconstruction, smoking increases the risk\nof donor complications. Patients should be encouraged to stop smoking prior to reconstruction.\n\u0017Smoking has not definitively been shown to increase the risk of microvascular thrombosis in free flap breast reconstruction.\n\u2022 Breast size/shape\n\u0017If patient has significant macromastia or ptosis, consideration can be given to a reduction pattern mastectomy with either implant-based or\nautologous tissue reconstruction, or oncoplastic reduction techniques.\n\u0017The volume limitations of implants may preclude an acceptable reconstruction in patients with macromastia if preservation of volume is a\npriority.\n\u2022 BMI\n\u0017Patients with a markedly elevated BMI may be at increased risk of infectious complications and seromas as well as donor site\ncomplications from autologous reconstruction, including delayed healing and hernia formation. Immediate reconstruction can be\nperformed, but delayed reconstruction can be considered if the patient is motivated to lose weight. Oncoplastic reduction techniques can\nbe considered if the breast is large/ptotic.\n\u2022 Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) and other rare implant-associated malignancies\n\u0017BIA-ALCL commonly presents with delayed periprosthetic effusion and breast asymmetry occurring >1 year after implantation.\n\u0017Rarely, BIA-ALCL can present with a mass, regional lymphadenopathy, overlying skin rash, and/or capsular contracture.\n\u0017Similar symptoms can also be seen in breast implant associated squamous cell carcinoma (BIA-SCC), another rare implant associated\nmalignancy. Individuals with breast implants have a very small risk of developing BIA-ALCL (average 7\u20139 years after implantation) and BIA-\nSCC (average 22 years after implantation).\n\u0017The majority of cases of BIA-ALCL have been seen in textured implants, while BIA-SCC is associated with either smooth or textured\nimplants. Rare cases of implant associated diffuse large B-cell lymphomas have also been reported.

    "chunk_42": "t, including Paget disease, bloody\nnipple discharge associated with malignancy, IBC, and/or imaging findings suggesting malignant involvement of the nipple or subareolar\ntissues.\n\u0017Nipple margin assessment is mandatory and should be clearly designated on the specimen.\n\u0017Preoperative breast size, shape, and nipple position should also be considered in the decision to perform NAC-sparing mastectomy.\nPatients with small to moderate breast volume with good nipple position are ideal candidates. In patients with large or significantly ptotic\nbreasts, NAC-sparing mastectomies may be offered in select cases by using various reduction patterns or delay techniques to augment\nthe NAC perfusion, either in an immediate or delayed fashion, as long as it does not delay oncologic care. Intraoperative assessment of the\nNAC perfusion should also guide the decision to preserve the NAC or remove it.\n\u0017Patients should be counseled on the risk of delayed healing, nipple necrosis, loss of pigmentation, loss of sensation, loss of projection,\nand need for subsequent removal of the NAC.\n\u0017Topical 2% nitroglycerine (45 mg total dose) used prophylactically has been shown to reduce mastectomy skin flap necrosis in both skin-\nsparing mastectomy and nipple sparing mastectomy in one randomized control trial.\n\u2022 Inflammatory breast cancer\n\u0017Delayed reconstruction after mastectomy for IBC remains the clinical standard for several reasons. The need to resect involved skin\nnegates the benefit of skin-sparing mastectomy for immediate reconstruction, and high rates of local and distant recurrence warrant\ncomprehensive RNI in a timely fashion, which may be technically more challenging or subject to delay after immediate reconstruction.\n\u0017Advances in multimodal therapy have improved 5-year survival in patients with IBC, justifying clinical studies to see if immediate\nreconstruction may be appropriate for certain patients with IBC, but neither the outcomes nor the clinical features to predict such\noutcomes are known at this time.\n\u0017In the uncommon clinical circumstance that the extent of skin excision at the time of mastectomy precludes primary or local closure,\nreconstruction of the chest wall defect with autologous tissue is necessary, and concomitant immediate reconstruction may be\naccomplished.\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.\nBINV-H\n7 OF 7\nVersion 5.2025, 10/16/25 \u00a9 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network\u00ae (NCCN\u00ae), All rights reserved.

More frequent imaging may be needed for selected cases with\ninconsistent reproducibility. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) may be utilized with deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique to\nreduce normal tissue exposure of the heart, lung or liver.\n\u0017Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) should be used to evaluate dose, normal tissue constraints (ie, heart, lung), and planning target volumes\n(PTVs).\n\u2022 It is common for RT to follow chemotherapy when chemotherapy is indicated. See BINV-I 2 of 3.\n\u2022 In the setting of oligometastatic breast cancer, the currently available data do not support ablative metastasis-directed RT (ie, SBRT) for\nextending overall survival OS or PFS. In some cases, SBRT may be preferred over palliative radiotherapy to provide more durable local\ncontrol and pain relief.\nWhole Breast RT\n\u2022 Target definition is the breast tissue at risk.\n\u2022 RT dosing:\n\u0017The whole breast should receive a hypofractionated dose of 40\u201342.5 Gy in 15\u201316 fractions; in selected cases 45\u201350.4 Gy in 25\u201328 fractions\nmay be considered.\n\u0017A boost to the tumor bed is recommended in patients at higher risk for recurrence.

See below.\n\u2022 In the case of cT3N0, high-risk features for considering PMRT include, but are not limited to, young age and/or LVI.\n\u2022 Based on anatomic considerations and presence of reconstruction, various 3-D-, intensity modulated radiation therapy [IMRT], or volumetric modulated arc\ntherapy (VMAT) techniques using photons and/or electrons are appropriate.\n\u2022 PMRT details and dosing:\n\u0017The routine use of bolus is not recommended. Bolus should be used for inflammatory breast cancer and considered in clinically relevant situations\nwhere the dose to the skin may not be adequate.\n\u0017Chest wall RT dose may be delivered in conventional dosing of 45\u201350.4 Gy in 25\u201328 fractions or moderately hypofractionated dosing of 40\u201342.5 Gy in\n15\u201316 fractions.\n\u0017In patients who are at high risk for local recurrence, a chest wall scar boost may be considered of approximately 10 Gy delivered in 4-5 fractions with or\nwithout bolus.\nRegional Nodal Radiation\n\u2022 For supra/infra-clavicular and axillary nodes, prescription depth varies based on the patient anatomy.\ne,f\n\u2022 Regional nodes should be contoured when when RNI is indicated.

All Rights Reserved.\nNCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nInvasive Breast Cancer\nDiscussion\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR BREAST CANCER IN MALES (SEX ASSIGNED AT BIRTH)\nNCCN recommendations have been developed to be inclusive of individuals of all sexual and gender identities to the greatest extent\npossible. On this page, the terms males and females refer to sex assigned at birth.\n\u2022 Few males have been included in breast cancer trials.1 Therefore, recommendations regarding management of breast cancer in males are\ngenerally extrapolated from findings of clinical trials focusing on breast cancer in females.\n\u2022 Although there are some biologic and clinical differences between breast cancer in males and females, management of breast cancer in\nmales is similar overall to management of breast cancer in females, with the following special considerations pertinent to male patients2:\n\u0017Genetics: The NCCN Panel recommends consideration of genetic testing for all males with breast cancer (See NCCN Guidelines for\nGenetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate).\n\u0017Breast surgery: Historically, males with breast cancer have undergone mastectomy more often than BCS. However, breast-conservation\ntherapy is increasingly being performed in males and evolving data indicate that breast conservation in males is associated with\nequivalent outcomes to mastectomy and that it is safe and feasible. Decisions about breast conservation versus mastectomy in males\nshould be made according to similar criteria as for females.2-9\n\u0017Axillary lymph node surgery: As in females, SLNB should be performed in the setting of male breast cancer with a clinically node-negative\naxilla.2,4\n\u0017RT: Indications for radiation after breast surgery in males with breast cancer are the same as for females with breast cancer.2,5,10,11\n\u0017Use of molecular assays: Data are limited regarding the use of molecular assays to assess prognosis and to predict benefit from\nchemotherapy in males with breast cancer.2 Available data suggest the 21-gene assay recurrence score provides prognostic information\nin males with breast cancer.12,13\n\u0017Preoperative/adjuvant systemic therapy: Chemotherapy with/without HER2-targeted therapy should be recommended for males with\nbreast cancer according to guidelines for females with breast cancer.2 Options for adjuvant endocrine therapy for males with breast\ncancer include tamoxifen for 5\u201310 years or, if tamoxifen is contraindicated, a GnRH analog plus an aromatase inhibitor. In males, single-\nagent adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor has been associated with inferior outcomes compared to tamoxifen alone, likely due\nto inadequate estradiol suppression, and is not recommended.2,14-17\n\u0017Follow-up after treatment for early-stage disease: There are only limited data to support screening for breast cancer in males.2 The NCCN\nPanel recommends that bone density be assessed at baseline and every 2 years in males with breast cancer who receive adjuvant GnRH\nanalog therapy. Low bone density should be managed according to standard guidelines.18\n\u0017Systemic therapy for advanced disease: Management of advanced breast cancer in males is similar to that in females; however, it is\npreferred that when an aromatase inhibitor is used, a GnRH analog should be given concurrently.2 Available data suggest single-agent\nfulvestrant has similar efficacy in males as in females.19 CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant,\nmTOR inhibitors, and PIK3CA inhibitors have not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials in males with breast cancer. However,\navailable real-world data suggest comparable efficacy and safety profiles and it is reasonable to recommend these agents to males\nbased on extrapolation of data from studies comprised largely of female participants with advanced breast cancer. Indications for and\nrecommendations regarding chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and PARP inhibitors for advanced breast cancer in\nmales are similar to those for advanced breast cancer in females.1\nReferences on BINV-J 2 of 2\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.\nBINV-J\n1 OF 2\nVersion 5.2025, 10/16/25 \u00a9 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network\u00ae (NCCN\u00ae), All rights reserved.

The correlation between pathologic response and long-\nterm outcome is strongest for TNBC, somewhat less so for HER2-positive disease, and least for ER-positive disease.c,d\n\u2022 A number of chemotherapy regimens have activity in the preoperative setting. In general, those chemotherapy regimens recommended in\nthe adjuvant setting may be considered in the preoperative setting. See Preoperative/Adjuvant Therapy Regimens (BINV-M).\n\u2022 Preoperative endocrine therapy alone may be considered for patients with ER-positive disease based on comorbidities or low-risk luminal\nbiology based on clinical characteristics and/or genomic signatures (until desired effect is achieved). Data shows that optimal duration for\nresponse if achieved between 4\u20136 months.e\n\u2022 Patients with HER-2 positive, \u2265cT2 and/or cN+ should be considered for HER2-directed therapy preoperatively. See Preoperative/Adjuvant\nTherapy Regimens (BINV-M).\n\u2022 Some studies suggest an increased risk of locoregional recurrence following use of preoperative chemotherapy.f These trials delivered\nchemotherapy regimens that are no longer standard, did not include targeted therapies, did not use modern imaging techniques, and/or\nused non-standard locoregional management. Care should be taken to follow the procedures outlined in BINV-12 and BINV-14 to assure\nappropriate locoregional management. Not all patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative systemic therapy. Accurate clinical\nstaging at baseline prior to initiation of preoperative systemic therapy is critical. See Potentially Operable Disease: Breast and Axillary\nEvaluation Prior to Preoperative Systemic Therapy (BINV-12).\n\u2022 Tumor response should be routinely assessed by clinical exam and imaging studies (see footnote uu on BINV-13) during delivery of\npreoperative therapy. It is preferred that the standard regimen is completed prior to surgery. If all intended treatment is not completed prior\nto surgery, the remainder may be given in the adjuvant setting. Patients with operable breast cancer experiencing progression of disease\nduring preoperative systemic therapy may be given an alternate systemic regimen or proceed to surgery if deemed resec",

Natural menopause is experienced between ages 42\u201358\nyears.\n\u2022 Breast cancer treatments may affect ovarian function and menses.\n\u0017In those who are premenopausal at the beginning of chemotherapy and who develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, ovarian function\nmay still be intact despite amenorrhea or may resume over time. The likelihood of ovarian function resuming after chemotherapy is higher\namong those aged <40 years.\n\u0017Tamoxifen may cause amenorrhea without inducing menopause in premenopausal individuals.\n\u0017Ovarian function suppression induces amenorrhea and reduces ovarian estrogen synthesis without causing permanent menopause.\n\u2022 Twelve months of amenorrhea alone is insufficient to diagnose menopause with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea or with tamoxifen\n\u00b1 ovarian suppression.

Do not substitute trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki.\nThe selection, dosing, and administration of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities are complex. Modifications of drug dose\nand schedule and initiation of supportive care interventions are often necessary because of expected toxicities and individual patient variability, prior\ntreatment, and comorbidity.

Results of monitoring are classified as response/continued response to treatment, stable\ndisease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease. The clinician typically must assess and balance multiple different\nforms of information to make a determination regarding whether disease is being controlled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable.\nSometimes, this information may be contradictory. Clinicians should take into account patient preferences through a shared decision-making\nprocess.\nDefinition of Disease Progression\nUnequivocal evidence of progression of disease by one or more of these factors is required to establish progression of disease, either\nbecause of ineffective therapy or acquired resistance of disease to an applied therapy. Progression of disease may be identified through\nevidence of growth or worsening of disease at previously known sites of disease and/or of the occurrence of new sites of metastatic disease.\n\u2022 Findings concerning for progression of disease include:\n\u0017Worsening symptoms such as pain or dyspnea\n\u0017Evidence of worsening or new disease on physical examination\n\u0017Declining performance status\n\u0017Unexplained weight loss\n\u0017Increasing alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or bilirubin\n\u0017Hypercalcemia\n\u0017New radiographic abnormality or increase in the size of pre-existing radiographic abnormality\n\u0017New areas of abnormality on functional imaging (eg, bone scan, PET/CT)\n\u0017Increasing tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], CA 15-3, CA 27.29)a\na Rising tumor markers (eg, CEA, CA 15-3, CA 27.29) are concerning for tumor progression, but may also be seen in the setting of responding disease. An isolated\nincrease in tumor markers should rarely be used to declare progression of disease. Changes in bone lesions are often difficult to assess on plain or cross-sectional\nradiology or on bone scan. For these reasons, patient symptoms and serum tumor markers may be more helpful in patients with bone-dominant metastatic disease.\nContinued\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.\nBINV-R\n1 OF 3\nVersion 5.2025, 10/16/25 \u00a9 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network\u00ae (NCCN\u00ae), All rights reserved.

Generally, the same method of assessment should be used over time (eg, an abnormality found on chest CT should generally be\nmonitored with repeat chest CT).\n\u2022 Some non-clinically important variation in measurement of abnormalities by all serial studies is common and expected. Therefore, the use\nof objective and widely accepted criteria",
    "chunk_79": " for response, stability, and progression of disease are encouraged. Such systems include the\nResponse Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, et al. New response evaluation\ncriteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline [version 1.1]. Eur J Cancer 2009;45:228-247) and the WHO criteria (Miller AB, Hoogstraten\nB, Staquet M, Winkler A. Reporting results of cancer treatment. Cancer 1981;47:207-214).\n\u2022 Studies of functional imaging, such as radionuclide bone scans and PET imaging, are particularly challenging when used to assess\nresponse. In the case of bone scans, responding disease may result in a flare or increased activity on the scan that may be misinterpreted\nas disease progression, especially on the first follow-up bone scan after initiating a new therapy. PET imaging is challenging because of the\nabsence of a reproducible, validated, and widely accepted set of standards for disease activity assessment.\nContinued\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.\nBINV-R\n2 OF 3\nVersion 5.2025, 10/16/25 \u00a9 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network\u00ae (NCCN\u00ae), All rights reserved.

The following table is to provide guidance, and should be modified for the individual patient based\non sites of disease, biology of disease, and treatment regimen.

All Rights Reserved.\nNCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nBreast Cancer\nDiscussion\nAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)\nTNM Staging System For Breast Cancer\nPrimary Tumor (T) The T category of the primary tumor is defined by the same criteria regardless of whether it is based on clinical or pathological criteria, or both. The\nT category is based primarily on the size of the invasive component of the cancer. The maximum size of a tumor focus is used as an estimate of disease volume. The\nlargest contiguous dimension of a tumor focus is used, and small satellite foci of noncontiguous tumor are not added to the size. The cellular fibrous reaction to invasive\ntumor cells is generally included in the measurement of a tumor prior to treatment; however, the dense fibrosis observed following neoadjuvant treatment is generally\nnot included in the pathological measurement because its extent may overestimate the residual tumor volume. The clinical size of a primary tumor (T) can be measured\nbased on clinical findings (physical examination and imaging modalities, such as mammography, ultrasound, and MR imaging) and pathological findings (gross and\nmicroscopic measurements). Clinical tumor size (cT) should be based on the clinical findings that are judged to be most accurate for a particular case, although it may\nstill be somewhat inaccurate because the intent of some breast cancers is not always apparent with current imaging techniques and because tumors are composed of\nvarying proportions of noninvasive and invasive disease, which these techniques are currently unable to distinguish. Size should be measured to the nearest millimeter.\nIf the tumor size is slightly less than or greater than a cutoff for a given T classification the size should be rounded to the millimeter reading that is closest to the cutoff.\nFor example, a reported size of 4.9 mm is reported as 5 mm, or a size of 2.04 cm is reported as 2.0 cm (20 mm). The exception to this rounding rule is for a breast\ntumor sized between 1.0 and 1.4 mm. These sizes are rounded up to 2 mm, because rounding down would result in the cancer\u2019s being categorized as microinvasive\ncarcinoma (T1mi) defined as a size of 1.0 mm or less.\nTable 1.

Copyright \u00a9 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nNCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025\nBreast Cancer\nTreatment for Possible Primary Breast Cancer\nPatients with MRI-positive breast disease should undergo evaluation with\nultrasound or MRI-guided biopsy and receive treatment according to the\nclinical stage of the breast cancer. Treatment recommendations for those\nwith MRI-negative disease are based on nodal status. For patients with\nT0, N1, M0 disease, options include mastectomy plus axillary nodal\ndissection or axillary nodal dissection plus whole breast irradiation with\nor without nodal irradiation. Systemic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy,\nor trastuzumab is given according to the recommendations for stage II or\nIII disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, trastuzumab, and endocrine\ntherapy should be considered for patients with T0, N2\u2013N3, M0 disease\nfollowed by axillary nodal dissection and mastectomy as for patients with\nlocally advanced disease.\nSummary\nThe therapeutic options for patients with noninvasive or invasive breast\ncancer are complex and varied. In many situations, the patient and\nphysician have the responsibility to jointly explore and select the most\nappropriate option from among the available alternatives. With few\nexceptions, the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up recommendations in\nthese guidelines are based on the results of past and present clinical\ntrials. However, there is not a single clinical situation in which the\ntreatment of breast cancer has been optimized with respect to either\nmaximizing cure or minimizing toxicity and disfigurement. Therefore,\npatient/physician participation in prospective clinical trials allows patients\nto not only receive state-of-the-art cancer treatment but also to contribute\nto improving the treatment outcomes.\nMS-86\nVersion 5.2025 \u00a9 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network\u00a9 (NCCN\u00a9), All rights reserved.
